= Secure Credentials Broker Demo

This application can be used to test Secure Credentials Broker connectivity by deploying it to a Cloud Foundry platform that has CredHub and Secure Credentials Broker installed.
The demo application includes a deployment manifest that makes it simple to deploy the application.
Use the http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/getting-started.html[`cf` CLI] to target and authenticate to a Cloud Foundry platform, and run the following commands:

----
$ ../gradlew assemble
$ cf push
----

After deploying the application, send an HTTP request to the demo application with this command:

----
$ curl -X GET http://secure-credentials-demo.cf.example.com/test"
----

The application will retrieve display credentials from CredHub via Secure Credentials Broker and show them on the screen.
